The following variables can be found in the processed dataset.
-Subject. Test subject identifier, it is a numerical value of type factor.
-Activity. Activity label realized by subject (STANDING, SITTING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS).
-The rest are acceleration measurments, that can be further consulted (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The following information is provided:
    - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
    - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
    - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
    - Its activity label.
    - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
